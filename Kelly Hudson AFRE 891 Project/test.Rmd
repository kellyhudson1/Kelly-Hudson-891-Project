## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# Description: this is the master file that runs all scripts in 'project_ldfDemand.Rproj' 
# sequentially from start to finish to reproduce all tables and figures that
# report results in the study 
# The simulation results were generated in GAMS and therefore outside of this script, 
# please direct questions on the GAMS code and input data to the author

# list all R files in project
fileNames <- list.files(path = "dataverse_files", pattern = "R$")
class(fileNames)
fileNames
# number of files in "scripts" folder to run 
# minus one as don't need to run the masterFile twice
# minus N if don't want to run last N files
nFiles <- length(fileNames) - 1
nFiles

# time all script run time
startTimingAll <- proc.time()

# run all files in the "scripts" folder
for (i in 1:nFiles) {
  source(paste0(fileNames[i], sep = ""), echo = TRUE)
}

timeAll <- proc.time() - startTimingAll
timeAll
```
